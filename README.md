# ðŸ§® NumPy Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes **student exam performance data** using **NumPy**.  
It demonstrates how numerical computations can be done efficiently without Pandas.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
- Generate synthetic student data (500 students Ã— 4 subjects)
- Perform ranking and percentile analysis
- Compare top 10% and bottom 10% students
- Normalize scores using **Z-score**
- Handle missing values and fill them with mean
- Predict total marks using **Linear Algebra (@ matrix multiplication)**

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered
- NumPy arrays and operations  
- Vectorization and broadcasting  
- Random number generation  
- NaN handling and imputation  
- Aggregations and slicing  
- Linear algebra (`np.dot`, `@` operator)

---

## ðŸ“Š Sample Results
- Average, Total, Top/Bottom ranking
- Pass percentage (â‰¥ 200 marks)
- Correlation among subjects
- Weighted total score prediction

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download the `.ipynb` file  
2. Open it in **Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab**  
3. Run all cells in sequence  
4. Requires:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
